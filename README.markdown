Realized that, holy crap, I've never implemented Conway's Game of Life. So here it is.

Actually, now it's just a kind of general 2d cellular automata ... thing. B3S23 is Life. It's cool, but there are some seriously crazy emergent behaviors to be found here.

Pretty stream of consciousness. Neighbor finding is amazingly inefficient, but it does allow the world to wrap.
